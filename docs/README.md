# PlatyPS design documentation

This folder contains design documentation for the PlatyPS project. The documentation is intended for
contributors to the PlatyPS project and provides information on the design decisions, architecture,
and implementation details of the module.

The `archive` folder contains older versions of the design documents for reference. These documents
don't reflect the current state of the project and are provided for historical context.

New design documents will be added to this folder.
